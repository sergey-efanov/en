        <p>Hello! </p>
        <p><strong>This is a tracker of your creativity, and whenever you need help during a creative session, it can come to your aid.</strong></p>
        <p>This guide has been created to make it easier to navigate its functionality and features. We recommend reading it to get an idea of how it works in advance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text _first guide-container">
        <p>So, the creativity tracker consists of 8 fields. <strong class="text-change1">There is a navigator on the left side of the screen to move</strong> from one task to another. Please note that each input box has a word limit.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__img">
        <div class="image1 img"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text guide-container">
        <p><strong>The input boxes with gray text</strong> are the areas where you can write your answers. Don't be afraid that there is already text there - these are examples that may help you orient yourself. <strong>Click on the input box  - the text will disappear, and you can enter your own.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text-warning _container-warning">
        <p><strong>NB! We recommend not refreshing the page during the creative session with Brainstorm booster so that no idea is lost.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text guide-container">
        <p>The creative tracker has two additional features. Firstly, there are <strong>stickers with hints</strong> that can guide you in the right direction. We recommend paying attention to them.</p>
        <p>Secondly, there are <strong>notes on the fields next to the input box.</strong> We know that during a creative brainstorm, you may want to jot down ideas or associations on the side or on your phone. This space is exactly for that purpose, so you don't have to keep an additional note-taking app open during the brainstorm.</p>
        <p>In the creative tracker, you can record your ideas or team insights in the fields right in the tool.</p>
        <p><strong>NB!</strong> These notes will not be saved in the final document, they are needed for more productive and easy work during a creative session with Brainstorm booster. Therefore, if you want to save them, it's better to copy or take a screenshot.</p>
        <p>After each task, there is a <strong>"save" button.</strong> Don't forget to click it after each change in the answer to ensure that all ideas reach the final document intact.</p>
        <p>In tasks 2 and 8, you can add blocks for a new target audience and for summarizing each new idea, respectively. You can <strong>do this by clicking on the "add target audience" and "add block" buttons. You will see the same scheme with empty input boxes.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__img">
        <div class="image2 img"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="main__img">
        <div class="image3 img"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text guide-container">
        <p>In task 4, you need to choose emotions that the target audience may experience. Choose at least three from the list or add your own in the bottom-right corner.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__img">
        <div class="image4 img"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text guide-container">
        <p>The critical step in the creative tracker is the seventh task. Here is where fresh concepts are created. Keep track of the modifications after each stage as this phase will be finished in numerous steps</p>
        <p>First, we suggest you get creative, stepping away from your goal a little, and <strong>come up with any formats and themes.</strong></p>
        <p>Then click <strong>the “next” button.</strong> Three more fields will be added to the prior information, in which you must mix the format and theme and create a new idea by combining the incompatible.</p>
        <p>Finally, by clicking the "next" button once more, you will see your word pairs on the screen as well as a space to improve them and make them achievable for your goal.</p>
        <p>Be attentive, <strong>new hints appear on stickers each time.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="main__img">
        <div class="image5 img"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="main__guide-text guide-container">
        <p><strong><span class="text-change5">The saved input boxes are highlighted in green on the navigator on the left. </span>If you have completed all the stages and haven’t left any blank fields, you can move on.</strong> A PDF file will be created for you that will record all your answers. You can check it, download it, or go back and add something in the input boxes (don't forget to click 'save'). You can share it with colleagues, and all stages of the creative session will be collected in one place.</p>
